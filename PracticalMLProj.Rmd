# Practical Machine Learning Project

## Introduction
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

# Data
We download the two datasets
```{r}
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(randomForest)
library(corrplot)
```

```{r}
trainUrl <-"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
testUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
trainFile <- "./data/pml-training.csv"
testFile  <- "./data/pml-testing.csv"
if (!file.exists("./data")) {
  dir.create("./data")
}
if (!file.exists(trainFile)) {
  download.file(trainUrl, destfile=trainFile, method="curl")
}
if (!file.exists(testFile)) {
  download.file(testUrl, destfile=testFile, method="curl")
}
```
After downloading the data, we read the two csv files into two data frames.  
```{r}
trainRaw <- read.csv("./data/pml-training.csv")
testRaw <- read.csv("./data/pml-testing.csv")
dim(trainRaw)
dim(testRaw)
```

The training data has 19622 observations and 160 features, the testing data contains 20 observations and 160 features. The "classe" variable in the training set is the outcome to predict.

## Ceaning our data
We clean the data and get rid of observations with missing values as well as other meaningless variables. This gives us a clean dataset to train and test.
```{r}
sum(complete.cases(trainRaw))
```
We remove columns that contain "NA" missing values.
```{r}
trainRaw <- trainRaw[, colSums(is.na(trainRaw)) == 0] 
testRaw <- testRaw[, colSums(is.na(testRaw)) == 0] 
```  
Then, we get rid of columns that dont contribute to the accelerometer measurements.
```{r}
classe <- trainRaw$classe
trainRemove <- grepl("^X|timestamp|window", names(trainRaw))
trainRaw <- trainRaw[, !trainRemove]
trainCleaned <- trainRaw[, sapply(trainRaw, is.numeric)]
trainCleaned$classe <- classe
testRemove <- grepl("^X|timestamp|window", names(testRaw))
testRaw <- testRaw[, !testRemove]
testCleaned <- testRaw[, sapply(testRaw, is.numeric)]
```
The cleaned training data set contains 19622 observations and 53 variables, while the testing data contains 20 observations and 53 variables. The "classe" variable is still in the cleaned training set.

## Splitting the dataset
Next, we split the cleaned training set into a pure training data set (70%) and a validation data set (30%). We will use the validation data set to conduct cross validation in future steps. This ensures we use the best model on the testing data set.
```{r}
set.seed(1905) # For reproducibile purpose
inTrain <- createDataPartition(trainCleaned$classe, p=0.70, list=F)
trainData <- trainCleaned[inTrain, ]
testData <- trainCleaned[-inTrain, ]
```

## Data Modeling
We fit a predictive model for activity recognition using the random forest mdoel because it automatically selects important variables and is robust to correlated covariates & outliers in general. We use 5-fold cross validation when applying the algorithm.  
```{r}
controlRf <- trainControl(method="cv", 5)
modelRf <- train(classe ~ ., data=trainData, method="rf", trControl=controlRf, ntree=250)
modelRf
```
Finally, we estimate the performance of the model on the validation data set.  
```{r}
predictRf <- predict(modelRf, testData)
confusionMatrix(as.factor(testData$classe), predictRf)
```
```{r}
accuracy <- postResample(predictRf, as.factor(testData$classe))
accuracy
oose <- 1 - as.numeric(confusionMatrix(as.factor(testData$classe), predictRf)$overall[1])
oose
```
Hence, the estimated accuracy of the model is 99.09% and the estimated out-of-sample error is 0.009%.

## Predicting for Test Data Set
Now, we apply the model to the original testing data set downloaded from the data source. We remove the `problem_id` column first.
```{r }
result <- predict(modelRf, testCleaned[, -length(names(testCleaned))])
result
```
